# ðŸ“š Book Club API Spec

This project defines a simple Book Club API built with Go + Gin, using mock in-memory data for simplicity. It's designed to simulate a real-world backend system that supports a frontend web dashboard.


---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Build a RESTful API that allows users to:

- View book clubs
- Join clubs
- Propose books
- Vote on books
- Track the currently selected book

This API should support a mock frontend app (`book-club-ui`) and be testable with curl, Postman, Thunder Client, or REST Client extensions.

---

## ðŸ§‘ Assumed User

For now, the logged-in user is hardcoded:

```json
{
  "username": "alice"
}

All membership and voting logic should assume requests come from this user.
